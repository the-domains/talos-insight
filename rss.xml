            <title><![CDATA[Why I Sci-Fi]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why I Sci-Fi</h1><p>As a kid I was never cool; I know surprising for a tech geek. It wasn't the other kids' fault that they didn't understand me, I was just a little too different to fit into any of the normal primary school archetypes.  It might have been the touch of foreignness that I got from spending several months of the year abroad in the Philippines while the other kids bonded over the shenanigans of a U.S. childhood summer. Or it could be the fact that I committed the social suicide move of liking school and not hiding this fact from other students. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/216d5192cc25d1999ae03dd4a485f1976573ba12.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creating Our Own</h1><p>One of my many roles within Talos International is designing and overseeing the general aesthetic of the company. As our President and Executive works to realize the outreaching potential, I work to inspire each project and division with simplicity and clarity in design.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Motivation Through Mission</h1><p>At Talos International we talk a lot about our mission and the philosophy we follow. But where does this come from? Why do we feel that we need either?  Beyond any argument about the need for change, it makes work enormously rewarding when your daily wage is made in the service of doing something good not just for yourself but for others.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8ea194b62d48cc9a4695674450e00d80bb5764d1.png"></article>]]></description>
