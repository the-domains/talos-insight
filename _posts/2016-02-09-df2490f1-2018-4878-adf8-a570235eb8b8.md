At Talos International we talk a lot about our mission and the philosophy we follow. But where does this come from? Why do we feel that we need either?  Beyond any argument about the need for change, it makes work enormously rewarding when your daily wage is made in the service of doing something good not just for yourself but for others.

Everyone in our company finds different motivations to embrace our philosophy but for me it comes from a desire to see the things I play a role in creating have a positive impact on people's lives. It is a simple thing to be concerned for others but it is a choice that has the potential to solve many of the problems we are all facing as my generation comes of age; we after all will inherit a world where the effects of climate change and our parents' lifestyle choices are a daily reality. 

But don't just listen to me, take a bit of advice from "the happiest man in the world" and watch this great TED talk from Mattheui Ricard. He captures perfectly the motivations behind our mission and philosophy as well as highlights why change is so necessary.
