Why I Sci-Fi
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/630b396c-32fd-40e1-913a-92b3b552dd81.jpg)

As a kid I was never cool; I know surprising for a tech geek. It wasn't the other kids' fault that they didn't understand me, I was just a little too different to fit into any of the normal primary school archetypes.  It might have been the touch of foreignness that I got from spending several months of the year abroad in the Philippines while the other kids bonded over the shenanigans of a U.S. childhood summer. Or it could be the fact that I committed the social suicide move of liking school and not hiding this fact from other students. 

Whatever it was, I didn't get other kids and for the most part they didn't get me. But lucky for me, sometime during my social exile I found my way to the Science Fiction section of my public school's library. Suddenly, I discovered there were entire worlds full of people that were outsiders, just like me. They lived on planets far and near, rode dragons, and created dazzling cities with amazing technology.

This early discovery of Sci-Fi followed me through life. I went to college and studied physics. I did research on particles being flung from the farthest reaches of space. The worlds I read about in books inspired me to imagine more for this world I was living in.  Science fiction and fantasy ask us to forget for a moment "what is" and instead consider "what could be". Then it wraps this in a story that questions morality and mission in every considerable context. 

If you could ask me what we could do right now, to make everyone more thoughtful and imaginative; to inspire that spark of innovation and out-of-the-box thinking that seems to be so desperately needed but in such short supply. I would tell you to ask people to sit down with a book from the Science Fiction section of their local public library. 

These stories are far more than a safe haven for an awkward 5th grader. They are inspiration and guidance as we launch rockets billions of miles into space in search of the unknown and reshape the world we live in with technology and commerce.
